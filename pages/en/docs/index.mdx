<FAQBox title="Can I use Nextra with Next.js app router?">
  No, Nextra only works with the `/pages` directory at the moment. Support for the app router has not been implemented
  yet. But you can use `/app` and `/pages` at the same time - just put your docs inside `/pages` and your other routes
  in `/app`
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can I use X with Nextra?">
